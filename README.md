What is an Agile Prototyping?

Agile prototyping is a flexible and user-centered method for developing product prototypes in the course of development. The first step in the process is gathering requirements and determining what users need. Next, a simple prototype is made. Although it may not have every feature yet, it provides a rough concept of the product. After receiving input from users and stakeholders, the prototype is gradually improved. Until the result lives up to everyone's expectations, this cycle is repeated.

Golden points:

Today, the key to success is speed. Build fast, get feedback fast, and improve fast. Instead of aiming for perfection, aim for progress. Each cycle of feedback and improvement gets you closer to something people truly want.
The developers that master this cycle are the ones that will thrive. So start small, move quickly, and always keep your users at the center of everything that you do.

#### Feedback

The most important part is to get feedback early.
